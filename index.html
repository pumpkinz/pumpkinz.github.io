    <h5>Hacker News reader for Android with material design, done right.</h5>

    <p>Why another HN app? Well, we've tried several of HN app out there in Google Play Store, but we never found the one that suits our taste, so we build one!</p>

    <p>Pumpkin Reader is the manifestation of what we see the ideal HN app for our needs.</p>

    <p>We only support Android 4.4+ because we believe that fragmentation in Android world is really bad. Hence the only way to go is to quickly abandon the older and now irrelevant versions.</p>
